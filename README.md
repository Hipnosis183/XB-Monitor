XB-Monitor+
-----------

***XB-Monitor+*** is a loader for *Examu's eX-BOARD* arcade machines software.<br>
Originally developed by *Romhack*: *[xb_monitor](https://github.com/zxmarcos/xb_monitor)*

Some features were added/changed/removed:

- Added support for *AxisR*, *AxisZ* and *POVs*
- Added option *PovAsAxis*
- Corrected the *sensitivity* of the *deadzone*
- Added the standard *SavePatch* function
- Developed a new configuration user interface
- Removed the *DirectDraw* wrapper
- Fixed some bugs in the *Direct3D* wrapper
- Deactivated the *logging* engine

The game ***Arcana Heart 3*** might need compatibility mode enabled in newer systems in order to work.

The code has been cleaned up a lot and reorganized completely, with some parts rewritten, so should be easier to see what's going on.
